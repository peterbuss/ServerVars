From me the coder, on adding a netlify serverless function

$ npm install netlify-cli -g

$ netlify init

=> created .netlify directory

D:\Documents\React\Scrimba\AI Engineering\NetlifyServerlessFcts>netlify init

Adding local .netlify folder to .gitignore file...
? What would you like to do? â‡„  Connect this directory to an existing Netlify site

netlify link will connect this folder to a site on Netlify

? How do you want to link this folder to a site? Use current git remote origin (https://github.com/peterbuss/ServerVars)



Looking for sites connected to 'https://github.com/peterbuss/ServerVars'...


Directory Linked

Admin url: https://app.netlify.com/sites/servervars
Site url:  https://servervars.netlify.app

You can now run other `netlify` cli commands in this directory


Success
This site "servervars" is configured to automatically deploy via https://github.com/peterbuss/ServerVars

D:\Documents\React\Scrimba\AI Engineering\NetlifyServerlessFcts>

Now use the netlify cli to give the serverless function

$ netlify functions:create

? Select the type of function you'd like to create Serverless function (Node/Go/Rust)

â—ˆ functions directory not specified in netlify.toml or UI settings
? Enter the path, relative to your site, where your functions should live: netlify/functions
â—ˆ updating site settings with netlify/functions
â—ˆ functions directory netlify/functions updated in site settings
â—ˆ functions directory netlify\functions does not exist yet, creating it...
â—ˆ functions directory netlify\functions created
? Select the language of your function JavaScript

? Name your function: fetchAI
â—ˆ Creating function fetchAI
â—ˆ Created D:\Documents\React\Scrimba\AI Engineering\NetlifyServerlessFcts\netlify\functions\fetchAI\fetchAI.js

Function created!

"type" : "module" in package.json not done!

D:\Documents\React\Scrimba\AI Engineering\NetlifyServerlessFcts>

Type the url https://main--servervars.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/fetchAI

should get {"message":"Hello World"} in the browser and it does!

So now build ai into app

First modify index to make a fetch request to serverless function

=> I got "Hello World" in the console as expected, good!

in console message!

Now add AI processing to serverless function fetchAI.js

ok.
